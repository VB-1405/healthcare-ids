"""
This file is kept so your repo structure stays consistent.

Right now, IDS logic is:
- YAML driven for ping-scan threshold rule (rules/rules.yaml)
- plus simple allowlist checks from config.yaml

You can later expand this module to provide more YAML rule types
and import them in ids.py if you want.
